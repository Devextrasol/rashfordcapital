      <h2 class="ui teal header">About</h2>
      <p>
        The Cash competitions add-on extends the functionality of
        <a href="https://1.envato.market/j4Gvn" target="_blank">Crypto Trading Competitions</a> and
        <a href="https://1.envato.market/kv1mM" target="_blank">Stock Trading Competitions</a> applications and provides the following features.
      </p>
      <h3 class="ui header">Fees</h3>
      <p>
        An administrator can create trading competitions, which require users to pay a predefined fee before joining such competition. Fees are deducted from user account balance, so users will need to deposit funds before fees can be paid.
      </p>
      <h3 class="ui header">Rewards (cash prizes)</h3>
      <p>
        An administrator can set up automatic allocation of collected fees between competition winners. It's possible to set either percentage allocation (for example, 30% of total fees collected goes to the winner, 20% of total fees goes to the runner-up and 10% of total fees goes to the third-place finisher) or a flat reward (for example, 50 USD paid to the winner, 30 USD paid to the runner-up, 10 USD paid to the third-place finisher). Winners can then spend their cash rewards on other paid competitions or withdraw them.
      </p>
